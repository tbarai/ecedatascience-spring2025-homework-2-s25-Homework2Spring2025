    # data is a dictionary that contains the following keys: 'data', 'n', 'min_val', 'max_val'
    # n is an integer

# Here, the function first checks if the lower and upper bounds are the same, 
# if they are it prints an error message and returns an empty list. 
# If lower bound is greater than upper bound, it swaps their values. 
# If number of bins is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty list. 
# Then it initializes an empty list hist of length n and calculates the width of each bin. 
# Then it iterates through the data, 
# and for each value checks if it is within the range of the histogram and if it is, 
# it increments the bin it belongs to. Finally, it returns the histogram.

# We first define the current year as 2024, which will be used to calculate the age of each person later on.
# We create an empty dictionary month_to_people_data that will store the final data in the format specified in the problem statement.
# We iterate over the both values in the tuple of the person_to_month list (note that person_to_month is a list of tuples, which means each item in the list is a tuple) 
# using a for loop. For each iteration, we extract the corresponding day, year and age values from the person_to_day and person_to_year lists using the current name as the "key".
# We then use the current month as the key and a tuple of (name, day, year, age) as the value to update the month_to_people_data dictionary.
# Only change the value to a list data type, when there are multiple entries with the same key. This will help append for other tuples to the same month.
# Finally, we return the month_to_people_data dictionary as the output of the function.
